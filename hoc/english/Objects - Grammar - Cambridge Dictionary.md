 
Objects are typically noun phrases (a noun or pronoun and any dependent words before or after it). Objects normally~={red} follow the verb=~ in a clause:

> _Everyone likes **her**. She knows **everyone**._

> _They didn’t take their **mountain bikes** with them._

 **[[tranlate object in english detail]]**

There are **direct objects** and ~={green}indirect objects=~. A direct object (in bold) is the thing or person that is affected by the **action** of the **verb**. An~={green} indirect object=~ (green) is usually a ~={green}person=~ (or ~={green}animal=~) who **receives** a direct object:

> _They gave ~={green}her=~ a present when she left._

> _Can you get ~={green}me=~ **some butter**?_

## Direct objects

A direct object shows who or what the **action** of the verb **affects**:

> _That computer hasn’t got a **mouse**._

> _Nobody writes **letters** these days._

> _Does she play **tennis**?_

## Indirect objects

An indirect object is usually a ~={green}person=~ or an ~={green}animal=~. The indirect object (green) **receives** or is affected by the **direct object** (in bold). An indirect object always needs a direct object with it and always comes before the direct object:(~={green}indirect sure receives  direct =~)-- kiểu như ~={green}the dog nhận dinner,dinner của the dog v:=~

> _She gave <u>the dog</u> its **dinner.**

> _Do I owe <u>you</u> some **money**?_

We can often rephrase such sentences with a prepositional phrase using _to_ or _for_ + the recipient. In this case, the direct object usually comes first.

## Verbs and objects

Some verbs (often called transitive verbs) need an object to complete their meaning. Some verbs (often called intransitive verbs) do not take an object. Some verbs need both a direct object and an indirect object. Some verbs can take a _wh_\-clause or a _that_\-clause as an object.

Some examples of verbs and objects:
